# Wheres DIALOG
A simple web game for guessing where you're at. 

You can guess the name of a DIALOG project (2pt) or the city/ municipality you're in (1pt).

Guesses are case and white space insensitive and the game accepts a list of potential project names to account for being known by multiple common terms.

The main branch of this project is the gh-pages branch. The API key in the repo is backend restricted and will not work for any url outside of this site's. You can use the Google Cloud Developer Console to generate your own as per the original repo.
